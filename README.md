# Stack-Overflow-Developer-Survey-2019
Dashboard

Using the data from stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019 created Dashboards using Cognos Dashboard Embedded (CDE) for at-a-glance view of some key results.
It shows the most used programming languages, data bases, webframes etc and their future trends.

The repository also contains a presentation(pdf form) based on the analysis of the data conducted. The presentation will develop into a story of analysis that is compelling and easy to understand.
